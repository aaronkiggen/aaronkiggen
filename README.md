## Hi there strangerðŸ‘‹

Iâ€™m Aaron Kiggen, an eco-evo-devo PhD student based in KU Leuven (Belgium).  Iâ€™m a PhD fellow specializing in the **molecular and evolutionary mechanisms of behavioral plasticity in Daphnia magna**. My work combines functional genomics and genetics with phenotypic data to uncover how gene regulatory networks drive rapid adaptive behaviors and how these might vary and evolve.

ðŸ§¬ I'm fascinated by the molecular mechanisms behind adaptation and how plasticity interacts with evolution. Honestly, if it has to do with evolutionâ€”no matter the speciesâ€”I'm all in.

##ðŸš€ Projects:
### [PhD](https://github.com/aaronkiggen/Daphnia-phd)  
This project investigates how Daphnia magna rapidly adjusts its behavior in response to predator cues, aiming to uncover the gene regulatory networks that drive this plasticity and how they evolve under natural selection. By uncovering how gene regulatory networks control behavioral plasticity and evolve over time, the project aims to reveal general principles of adaptation, the origins of phenotypic diversity, and the molecular mechanisms that shape evolutionary potential.

### [Thesis](https://github.com/aaronkiggen/Daphnia-thesis)  
This project aims to uncover how different Daphnia species respond at the molecular level to fish predation by integrating transcriptomic and population genomic data, helping to identify both conserved and divergent genetic mechanisms underlying predator-induced plasticity and their evolutionary significance.
